# Hybrid Image + Visualizing Optical Flow

## Background
  This project was an assignment for a 4rth year Computer Vision course. The objective of the assignment revolves around training a machine to detect faces given a set of images.

 ## How does the project work?
  The project works by first training an SVM using a set of collected images of faces. The trained SVM is then used to create a sliding window face detector, and coupled with non-maximum suppression is able to make fairly accurate detections with non-overlapping predictions and at various image scales.
